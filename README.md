User Management System
======================

In this project, the admin can add users, delete users, create groups, delete groups and add/remove users from group. 

I have also added the json format return for the tasks.

The following are routes for those:

-For listing the users - /api/user
-For listing groups - /api/group
-For adding a user - /api/add_user?name=(give name here)
-For deleting a user - /api/delete_user?id= (give id here)
-For adding a group - /api/add_group?name=(give group name here)
-For deleting a group - /api/delete_group?id= (give group id here)
